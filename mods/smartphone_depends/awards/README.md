# Introduction

## Awards and Triggers

An award is a single unlockable unit, registered like so:

```lua
awards.register_award("mymod:award", {
	description = "My Example Award",
})
```

Awards are unlocked either using `awards.unlock()` or by a trigger being
fullfilled. A trigger is a condition which unlocks an award. Triggers are
registered at the same time as an award is registered:

```lua
awards.register_award("mymod:award", {
	description = "My Example Award",
	trigger = {
		type   = "dig",
		node   = "default:stone",
		target = 10,
	},
})
```

The above trigger type is an example of a counted_key trigger:
rather than a single counter there's a counter per key - in this
case the key is the value of the `node` field.

If you leave out the key in a `counted_key` trigger, then the total will be used
instead. For example, here is an award which unlocks after you've placed 10
nodes of any type:

```lua
awards.register_award("mymod:award", {
	description = "Place 10 nodes!",
	trigger = {
		type   = "place",
		target = 10,
	},
})
```

You can also register an *Unlock Function*, which can return the name of an
award to unlock it:

```lua
awards.register_award("mymod:award", {
	title = "Lava Miner",
	description = "Mine any block while being very close to lava.",
})

awards.register_on_dig(function(player, data)
	local pos = player:get_pos()
	if pos and (minetest.find_node_near(pos, 1, "default:lava_source") or
			minetest.find_node_near(pos, 1, "default:lava_flowing")) then
		return "mymod:award"
	end
	return nil
end)
```

The above is a bad example as you don't actually need the stats data given.
It would be better to register a `dignode` callback and call `awards.unlock()`
if the condition is met.

## Trigger Types

The trigger type is used to determine which event will cause the trigger will be
fulfilled. The awards mod comes with a number of predefined types, documented
in [Builtin Trigger Types](#builtin-trigger-types).

Trigger types are registered like so:

```lua
awards.register_trigger("chat", {
	type = "counted",
	progress = "@1/@2 chat messages",
	auto_description = { "Send a chat message", "Chat @1 times" },
})

minetest.register_on_chat_message(function(name, message)
	local player = minetest.get_player_by_name(name)
	if not player or string.find(message, "/")  then
		return
	end
	awards.notify_chat(player)
end)
```

A trigger type has a type as well, which determines how the data is stored and
also how the trigger is fulfilled.

**Trigger Type Types:**

* **custom** requires you handle the calling of awards.unlock() yourself. You also
  need to implement on_register() yourself. You'll also probably want to implement
  `on_register()` to catch awards registered with your trigger type.
* **counted** stores a single counter for each player which is incremented by calling
  `trigger:notify(player)`. Good for homogenous actions like number of chat messages,
  joins, and the like.
* **counted_key** stores a table of counters each indexed by a key. There is also
  a total field (`__total`) which stores the sum of all counters. A counter is
  incremented by calling `trigger:notify(player, key)`. This is good for things like
  placing nodes or crafting items, where the key will be the item or node name.
  If `key` is an item, then you should also add `key_is_item = true` to the
  trigger type definition.

As said, you could use a custom trigger if none of the other ones match your needs.
Here's an example.

```lua
awards.register_trigger("foo", {
	type             = "custom",
	progress         = "@1/@2 foos",
	auto_description = { "Do a foo", "Foo @1 times" },

	on_register = function(self, award)
		print(award.name .. " was registered with foo trigger type")
	end,
})

minetest.register_on_foo(function()
	for _, trigger in pairs(awards.on.foo) do
		-- trigger is either a trigger tables or
		--   or an unlock function.

		-- some complex logic
		if condition then
			awards.unlock(trigger)
		end
	end
end)

```

## Award Difficulty

Difficulty is used to determine how awards are sorted in awards lists.

If the award trigger is counted, ie: the trigger requires a `target` property,
then the difficulty multipler is timesd by `target` to get the overall difficulty.
If the award isn't a counted type then the difficulty multiplier is used as the
overal difficulty. Award difficulty affects how awards are sorted in a list -
more difficult awards are further down the list.

In real terms, `difficulty` is a relative difficulty to do one unit of the trigger
if its counted, otherwise it's the relative difficulty of completely doing the
award (if not-counted). For the `dig` trigger type, 1 unit would be 1 node dug.


Actual code used to calculate award difficulty:

```lua
local difficulty = def.difficulty or 1
if def.trigger and def.trigger.target then
	difficulty = difficulty * def.trigger.target
end
```


# API

## Awards

* `awards.register_award(name, def)`, the def table has the following fields:
	* `title` - title of the award (defaults to name)
	* `description` - longer description of the award, displayed in Awards tab
	* `difficulty` - see [Award Difficulty](#award-difficulty).
	* `requires` - list of awards that need to be unlocked before this one
		is visible.
	* `prizes` - list of items to give when you earn the award
	* `secret` - boolean if this award is secret (i.e. showed on awards list)
	* `sound` - `SimpleSoundSpec` table to play on unlock.
		`false` to disable unlock sound.
	* `icon` - the icon image. Defaults to `awards_unknown.png`.
	* `hud_background` - the background image used in the HUD to contain the text and icon.
	                 Defaults to `awards_bg_default.png`.
	* `trigger` - trigger definition, see [Builtin Trigger Types](#builtin-trigger-types).
	* `on_unlock(name, def)` - callback on unlock.
* `awards.registered_awards` - table of award name to definition.
* `awards.register_on_unlock(func(name, def))`
	* `name` is the player name
	* `def` is the award def.
	* return true to cancel HUD from appearing.
* `awards.unlock(player_name, award_name)`
	* gives an award to a player
* `awards.remove(player_name, award_name)`
	* removes an award from a player
* `awards.get_award_states(player_name)`
	* Returns list of tables, sorted by `score`, each having the fields:

		```lua
		{
			name     = "mymod:awardname",
			def      = {}, -- Award definition
			unlocked = true, -- Whether award has been unlocked
			started  = true, -- Whether any progress has been made
			score    = 0, -- Score used in sorting

			-- Either a table or nil
			-- Will be nil if progress is indeterminable or
			-- if the award is unlocked
			progress = {
				current = 5,
				target  = 10,
				label   = "label", -- Label to show over progress bar
			}
		}
		```

## Triggers

* `awards.register_trigger(name, def)`, the def table has the following fields:
	* `type` - see trigger type types in [Trigger Types](#trigger-types).
	* `progress` - used to format progress, defaults to "%1/%2".
	* `auto_description` - a table of two elements. Each element is a format string. Element 1 is singular, element 2 is plural. Used for the award description (not title) if none is given.
	* `on_register(self, award_def)` - called when an award registers with this type.
	* "counted_key" only:
		* `auto_description_total` - Used if the trigger is for the total.
		* `get_key(self, def)` - get key for particular award, return nil for a total.
		* `key_is_item` - true if the key is an item name. On notify(),
			any watched groups will also be notified as `group:groupname` keys.
* `awards.registered_triggers` - table of trigger name to definition.

## Builtin Trigger Types

Callbacks (register a function to be run)

* dig type: Dig a node.
	* node: the dug node type. If nil, all dug nodes are counted
* place type: Place a node.
	* node: the placed node type. If nil, all placed nodes are counted
* craft type: Craft something.
	* item: the crafted item type. If nil, all crafted items are counted
* death type: Die.
	* reason: the death reason, one of the types in PlayerHPChangeReason (see lua_api.txt)
				or nil for total deaths.
* chat type: Write a chat message.
* join type: Join the server.
* eat type: Eat an item.
	* item: the eaten item type. If nil, all eaten items are counted

(for all types) target - how many times to dig/place/craft/etc.

Each type has a register function like so:

* awards.register_on_TRIGGERTYPE(func(player, data))
	* data is the player stats data
	* return award name or null
