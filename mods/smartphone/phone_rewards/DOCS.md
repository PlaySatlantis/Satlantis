# Server Admin
You can plan your battlepass levels and rewards by editing the `REWARDS.lua` file in the `<YOUR_WORLD_FOLDER>/phone_rewards/` folder. From there you'll be able to set the amount of points necessary to complete a level and to edit each level's normal and premium rewards.

When a new season begins, the battlepass can be reset by an admin (someone with the `server` privilege) using the /reset_battlepass command.
